#Rust Wishlist

A list of libraries or applications which various Rustaceans have shared a desire for, but which no one has stepped up to the challenge of creating. These are the most challenging but also most rewarding projects possible. You'll often have little to no help, and it will be your responsibility to your crate's users to maintain and upgrade it for the foreseeable future. 

But in return, you'll gain the undying respect and admiration of the Rust community for your invaluable contribution to the ecosystem. And it looks great on a CV.
