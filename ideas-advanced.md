#Advanced Project Ideas

More challenging projects which might take a while--maybe a weekend or two. These will probably necessitate some sort of module structure, and you may want to bring in external crates so you don't have to implement everything yourself.

Have a suggestion? Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. If you're adding an entry, please follow the style of the existing entries.

###Project Ideas Wanted!

We're not afraid to admit that we don't have any specific ideas for this section. We have some thoughts on some possiblities, but they need further discussion.

* A simple game with a graphical user interface (tetris, snake, etc)
* A basic web site with some server-side functionality
* A CLI networked chat client
* An interpreter for a simple-ish programming language (Brainfuck? Forth?)
* A simple database program
