#Programming Challenges

Sites and forums which provide generic or domain-specific programming challenges for you to complete. More often than not these are language-agnostic, and Rust is quite often underrepresented in submitted solutions. 

Suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or pull request. Please follow the style of the existing entries.

###DailyProgrammer (reddit)

If you're on reddit, or don't mind signing up, you can participate in the tri-weekly Daily Programmer challenge. Users submit solutions as comments to a challenge thread, and then vote on the most creative or unique solution. 

As of January 2016, Easy challenges are posted on Mondays, Intermediate-difficulty challenges are posted on Wednesdays, and Hard challenges are posted on Fridays.

Easy challenges can usually be tackled by anyone with some programming know-how. The solutions aren't overly complex and usually just involve some naive parsing and applying simple logic to a small dataset.

Intermediate level challenges are a good bit more complex and usually involve some knowledge of advanced datastructures and algorithms, though the challenge text will also often include a research guide and other tips on how to start on a solution.

Hard challenges require quite a bit of thought and usually end up with some pretty clever solutions. They often don't come with any tips or hints and require the challenger to use their own skills and knowledge to work out the solution.

###Project Euler

https://projecteuler.net

In a nutshell, Project Euler is a series of mathematical challenges which will require programming skills to solve. The first problems are simple arithmetical puzzles which most programmers learn to solve early on, as they make for easy examples for any given programming language. Later problems don't necessarily become more complex but they begin to incorporate more advanced maths knowledge like trigonometry. Some problems are complex simply because of the extremely large numbers involved.

If you have an aptitude for maths and want to challenge yourself in your knowledge of Rust, the Project Euler series comes highly recommended.
